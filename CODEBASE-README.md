# Starter Application for Hyperledger Fabric

Create a network to jump start development of your decentralized application on 
[Hyperledger Fabric](https://www.hyperledger.org/projects/fabric) platform.

The network is run by docker containers and can be deployed to one host for development or to multiple hosts for testing 
or production.

Scripts of this starter generate crypto material and config files, start the network and deploy your chaincodes. 
Developers can use [REST API](https://github.com/olegabu/fabric-starter-rest) to invoke and query chaincodes, 
explore blocks and transactions.

What's left is to develop your chaincodes and place them into the [chaincode](./chaincode) folder, 
and user interface as a single page web app that you can serve by by placing the sources into the [www](./www) folder.

# Install

Install prerequisites: `docker >=18.06.1` and `docker-compose >=1.22.0`.

## Ubuntu 18

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu bionic stable"
sudo apt update
sudo apt-get install docker-ce

sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.22.0/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose

# add yourself to the docker group and re-login
sudo usermod -aG docker ${USER}
```

## Mac OSX

Install `docker ce` and `docker compose` by [brew](https://brew.sh/).
```bash
brew install docker 
```

## Using a particular version of Hyperledger Fabric

To deploy network with a particular version of HL Fabric framework export desired version in the 
FABRIC_VERSION environment variable. The `latest` docker image tag is used by default.
```bash
export FABRIC_VERSION=1.2.0
```

# Create a network with 1 organization for development

## Generate and start orderer

Generate crypto material and the genesis block for the *orderer* organization. Using default *example.com* DOMAIN. 
```bash
./generate-orderer.sh
```

Start docker containers for *orderer*.
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose-orderer.yaml up
```

## Generate and start member organization

Open another console. Generate crypto material for the member organization. Using default ORG name *org1*.
```bash
./generate-peer.sh
```

Start docker containers for *org1*.
```bash
docker-compose up
```

## Add organization to the consortium and create a channel

Open another console. Add *org1* to the consortium as *Admin* of the *orderer* organization:
```bash
./consortium-add-org.sh org1
``` 

Create channel *common* as *Admin* of *org1* and join our peers to the channel:
```bash
./channel-create.sh common

./channel-join.sh common
``` 

## Install and instantiate chaincode

Install and instantiate *nodejs* chaincode *reference* on channel *common*. 
Using defaults: language `node`, version `1.0`, empty args `[]`.
Note the path to the source code is inside `cli` docker container and is mapped to the local folder 
[./chaincode/node/reference](./chaincode/node/reference). 
```bash
./chaincode-install.sh reference

./chaincode-instantiate.sh common reference
```

## Invoke chaincode

Chaincode *reference* extends [chaincode-node-storage](https://github.com/olegabu/chaincode-node-storage) 
which provides CRUD functionality.

Invoke chaincode to save entities of type *account*.
```bash
./chaincode-invoke.sh common reference '["put","account","1","{\"name\":\"one\"}"]'

./chaincode-invoke.sh common reference '["put","account","2","{\"name\":\"two\"}"]'
```

Query chaincode functions *list* and *get*.
```bash
./chaincode-query.sh common reference '["list","account"]'

./chaincode-query.sh common reference '["get","account","1"]'
```

## Upgrade chaincode 

Now you can make changes to your chaincode, install a new version `1.1` and upgrade to it.
```bash
./chaincode-install.sh reference 1.1

./chaincode-upgrade.sh common reference [] 1.1
```

When you develop and need to push your changes frequently, this shortcut script will install and instantiate with a 
new random version
```bash
./chaincode-reload.sh common reference
``` 

## Golang chaincode 

Install and instantiate *golang* chaincode *example02* on channel *common*. 
Source code is in local `./chaincode/go/chaincode_example02` mapped to `/opt/gopath/src/chaincode_example02` 
inside `cli` container.
```bash
./chaincode-install.sh example02 1.0 chaincode_example02 golang
./chaincode-instantiate.sh common example02 '["init","a","10","b","0"]'
./chaincode-invoke.sh common example02 '["move","a","b","1"]'
./chaincode-query.sh common example02 '["query","a"]'
```

Reload *golang* chaincode.
```bash
./chaincode-reload.sh common example02 '["init","a","10","b","0"]' chaincode_example02 golang
```

# Create a local network of 3 organizations

## Quick start

Use script [network-create-local.sh](./network-create-local.sh) to create a network with an arbitrary 
number of member organizations running in docker containers on the local machine.
```bash
./network-create-local.sh org1 org2 org3
```

This will create a network with `example.com` domain and container names like `peer0.org1.example.com`, 
`api.org2.example.com` and API ports 4000, 4001, 4002; will create a channel named *common* 
and nodejs chaincode *reference* with its source in this repo [./chaincode/node/reference](./chaincode/node/reference). 

Member organization's docker containers are started with default docker-compose config files 
`-f docker-compose.yaml -f couchdb.yaml`. You can override them by setting env variable `DOCKER_COMPOSE_ARGS`; for
example to start without a CouchDb container to use LevelDb for storage:
```bash
DOCKER_COMPOSE_ARGS="-f docker-compose.yaml" ./network-create-local.sh
```
 
You can give your network and channel names, set starting API port, override chaincode location, 
install and instantiate arguments.
```bash
DOMAIN=mynetwork.org \
CHANNEL=a-b \
WEBAPP_HOME=/home/oleg/webapp \
CHAINCODE_HOME=/home/oleg/chaincode \
CHAINCODE_INSTALL_ARGS='example02 1.0 chaincode_example02 golang' \
CHAINCODE_INSTANTIATE_ARGS="a-b example02 [\"init\",\"a\",\"10\",\"b\",\"0\"] 1.0 collections.json AND('a.member','b.member')" \
./network-create-local.sh a b
```

To understand the script please read the below step by step instructions for the network 
of three member organizations org1, org2, org3.

You can also extend this example by manually adding more than 3 organizations and any number of channels 
with various membership.

## Create orderer and member organizations and add them to the consortium

Clean up. Remove all containers, delete local crypto material:
```bash
./clean.sh
```

Generate crypto material and start docker containers of the *orderer* organization:
```bash
./generate-orderer.sh

docker-compose -f docker-compose-orderer.yaml up
```

Open another shell. Generate and start *org1*.
```bash
./generate-peer.sh

docker-compose up
```

Open another shell. Note since we're reusing the same `docker-compose.yaml` file we need to redefine `COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME`.
Redefine the api port mapped to the host to avoid collision with api.org1.

Generate and start *org2*.
```bash
export COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME=org2 ORG=org2 
export API_PORT=4001
```

Then start the peer
```bash
./generate-peer.sh

docker-compose up
```

Generate and start *org3* in another shell:
```bash
export COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME=org3 ORG=org3 
export API_PORT=4002

./generate-peer.sh

docker-compose up
```

Now you should have 4 console windows running containers of *orderer*, *org1*, *org2*, *org3* organizations.

Open another console where we'll become an *Admin* user of the *orderer* organization. We'll add orgs to the consortium:
```bash
./consortium-add-org.sh org1
./consortium-add-org.sh org2
./consortium-add-org.sh org3
``` 

Now all 3 orgs are known in the consortium and can create and join channels.

## Create channels, install and instantiate chaincodes

Open another console where we'll become *org1* again. We'll create channel *common*, add other orgs to it, 
and join our peers to the channel:
```bash
./channel-create.sh common
./channel-add-org.sh common org2 
./channel-add-org.sh common org3 
./channel-join.sh common
``` 

Let's create a bilateral channel between *org1* and *org2* and join to it:
```bash
./channel-create.sh org1-org2
./channel-add-org.sh org1-org2 org2 
./channel-join.sh org1-org2
```

Install and instantiate chaincode *reference* on channel *common*. Note the path to the source code is inside `cli` 
docker container and is mapped to the local  `./chaincode/node/reference`
```bash
./chaincode-install.sh reference
./chaincode-instantiate.sh common reference 
```

Install and instantiate chaincode *relationship* on channel *org1-org2*:
```bash
./chaincode-install.sh relationship
./chaincode-instantiate.sh org1-org2 relationship '["init","a","10","b","0"]'
```

Open another console where we'll become *org2* to install chaincodes *reference* and  *relationship* 
and to join channels *common* and *org1-org2*:
```bash
export COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME=org2 ORG=org2

./chaincode-install.sh reference
./chaincode-install.sh relationship
./channel-join.sh common
./channel-join.sh org1-org2
``` 

Now become *org3* to install chaincode *reference* and join channel *common*:
```bash
export COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME=org3 ORG=org3

./chaincode-install.sh reference
./channel-join.sh common
``` 

## Use REST API to query and invoke chaincodes

Login into *org1* as *user1* and save returned token into env variable `JWT` which we'll use to identify our user 
in subsequent requests:
```bash
JWT=`(curl -d '{"username":"user1","password":"pass"}' --header "Content-Type: application/json" http://localhost:4000/users | tr -d '"')`
```

Query channels *org1* has joined
```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $JWT" http://localhost:4000/channels
```
returns
```json
[{"channel_id":"common"},{"channel_id":"org1-org2"}]
``` 

Query status, orgs, instantiated chaincodes and block 2 of channel *common*:
```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $JWT" http://localhost:4000/channels/common
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $JWT" http://localhost:4000/channels/common/chaincodes
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $JWT" http://localhost:4000/channels/common/orgs
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $JWT" http://localhost:4000/channels/common/blocks/2
```

Invoke function `put` of chaincode *reference* on channel *common* to save entity of type `account` and id `1`:
```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $JWT" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
http://localhost:4000/channels/common/chaincodes/reference -d '{"fcn":"put","args":["account","1","{name:\"one\"}"]}'
```

Query function `list` of chaincode *reference* on channel *common* with args `["account"]`:
```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $JWT" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
'http://localhost:4000/channels/common/chaincodes/reference?fcn=list&args=%5B%22account%22%5D'
```

# Multi host deployment with docker-machine

## Prerequisites

Install [docker-machine](https://docs.docker.com/machine/get-started/).

## Quick start with virtual hosts on local dev machine

Install [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads).

Use script [network-create-docker-machine.sh](./network-create-docker-machine.sh) to create a network with an arbitrary 
number of member organizations each running in its own virtual host.
```bash
./network-create-docker-machine.sh org1 org2 org3
```

Of course you can override the defaults with env variables.
```bash
DOMAIN=mynetwork.org \
CHANNEL=a-b \
WEBAPP_HOME=/home/oleg/webapp \
CHAINCODE_HOME=/home/oleg/chaincode \
CHAINCODE_INSTALL_ARGS='example02 1.0 chaincode_example02 golang' \
CHAINCODE_INSTANTIATE_ARGS="a-b example02 [\"init\",\"a\",\"10\",\"b\",\"0\"] 1.0 collections.json AND('a.member','b.member')" \
./network-create-docker-machine.sh a b
```

The script [network-create-docker-machine.sh](./network-create-docker-machine.sh) combines
[host-create.sh](./host-create.sh) to create host machines with `docker-machine` and
[network-create.sh](./network-create.sh) to create container with `docker-compose`.

If you don't want to recreate hosts every time you can re-run `./network-create.sh` with the same arguments and 
env variables to recreate the network on the same remote hosts by clearing and creating containers.   

## Quick start with remote hosts on AWS EC2

Define `amazonec2` driver for docker-machine and open ports in `docker-machine` security group.
Make sure your AWS credentials are saved in env variables or `~/.aws/credentials` or passed as arguments
`--amazonec2-access-key` and `--amazonec2-secret-key`. 
More settings are described on the [driver page](https://docs.docker.com/machine/drivers/aws/).
```bash
DOCKER_MACHINE_FLAGS="--driver amazonec2 --amazonec2-open-port 80 --amazonec2-open-port 7050 --amazonec2-open-port 7051 --amazonec2-open-port 4000" \
./network-create-docker-machine.sh org1 org2 org3
```

## Quick start with remote hosts on Microsoft Azure

Define `azure` driver for docker-machine and open ports in network security groups. 
Give your subscription id (the one looking like `deadbeef-8bad-f00d-989d-5fbe969ccb9e`) and the script will prompt you
to login to your Microsoft account and authorize `Docker Machine for Azure` application to manage your Azure instances. 
More settings are described on the [driver page](https://docs.docker.com/machine/drivers/azure/).
```bash
DOCKER_MACHINE_FLAGS="--driver azure --azure-size Standard_A1 --azure-subscription-id <your subs-id> --azure-open-port 80 --azure-open-port 7050 --azure-open-port 7051 --azure-open-port 4000" \
./network-create-docker-machine.sh org1 org2
```

## Quick start with existing remote hosts

If you have already created remote hosts in the cloud or on premises you can connect docker-machine to these hosts and 
operate with the same scripts and commands.

Make sure the remote hosts have open inbound ports for Fabric network: 80, 4000, 7050, 7051 and for docker: 2376.

Connect via [generic](https://docs.docker.com/machine/drivers/generic/) driver 
to hosts *orderer*, *a* and *b* at specified public IPs with ssh private key `~/docker-machine.pem`.
```bash
docker-machine create --driver generic --generic-ssh-key ~/docker-machine.pem --generic-ssh-user ubuntu \
--generic-ip-address 34.227.123.456 orderer
docker-machine create --driver generic --generic-ssh-key ~/docker-machine.pem --generic-ssh-user ubuntu \
--generic-ip-address 54.173.123.457 a
docker-machine create --driver generic --generic-ssh-key ~/docker-machine.pem --generic-ssh-user ubuntu \
--generic-ip-address 54.152.123.458 b
```

Now the hosts are known to docker-machine and you can run `network-create.sh` script to create 
docker containers running the network and create organizations, channel and chaincode.
```bash
DOMAIN=mynetwork.org CHANNEL=a-b WEBAPP_HOME=/home/oleg/webapp CHAINCODE_HOME=/home/oleg/chaincode CHAINCODE_INSTALL_ARGS='example02 1.0 chaincode_example02 golang' CHAINCODE_INSTANTIATE_ARGS="a-b example02 [\"init\",\"a\",\"10\",\"b\",\"0\"] 1.0 collections.json AND('a.member','b.member')" \
./network-create.sh a b
```

## Drill down

To understand the script please read the below step by step instructions for the network 
of two member organizations org1 and org2.

### Create host machines

Create 3 hosts: orderer and member organizations org1 and org2.
```bash
docker-machine create orderer
docker-machine create org1
docker-machine create org2
```

### Create orderer organization

Tell the scripts to use extra multihost docker-compose yaml files.
```bash
export MULTIHOST=true
```

Copy config templates to the orderer host.
```bash
docker-machine scp -r templates orderer:templates
```

Connect docker client to the orderer host. 
The docker commands that follow will be executed on the host not local machine.
```bash
eval "$(docker-machine env orderer)"
```

Inspect created hosts' IPs and collect them into `hosts` file to copy to the hosts. This file will be mapped to the
docker containers' `/etc/hosts` to resolve names to IPs.
This is better done by the script.
Alternatively, edit `extra_hosts` in `multihost.yaml` and `orderer-multihost.yaml` to specify host IPs directly.

```bash
docker-machine ip orderer
docker-machine ip org1
docker-machine ip org2
```

Generate crypto material for the orderer organization and start its docker containers.
```bash
./generate-orderer.sh
docker-compose -f docker-compose-orderer.yaml -f orderer-multihost.yaml up -d
```

### Create member organizations

Open a new console. Use env variables to tell the scripts to use multihost config yaml and to name your organization.
```bash
export MULTIHOST=true && export ORG=org1
```

Copy templates, chaincode and webapp folders to the host.
```bash
docker-machine scp -r templates $ORG:templates && docker-machine scp -r chaincode $ORG:chaincode && docker-machine scp -r webapp $ORG:webapp
```

Connect docker client to the organization host.
```bash
eval "$(docker-machine env $ORG)"
```

Generate crypto material for the org and start its docker containers.
```bash
./generate-peer.sh
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yaml -f multihost.yaml up -d
```

To create other organizations repeat the above steps in separate consoles 
and giving them names by `export ORG=org2` in the first step.

### Add member organizations to the consortium

Return to the *orderer* console.

Now the member organizations are up and serving their certificates. 
The orderer host can download them to add to the consortium definition. 
```bash
./consortium-add-org.sh org1
./consortium-add-org.sh org2
```

### Create a channel and a chaincode

Return to the *org1* console.

The first organization creates channel *common* and joins to it.
```bash
./channel-create.sh common
./channel-join.sh common
```

And adds other organizations to channel *common*.
```bash
 ./channel-add-org.sh common org2
```

And installs and instantiates chaincode *reference*.
```bash
./chaincode-install.sh reference
./chaincode-instantiate.sh common reference
```

Test the chaincode by invoke and query.
```bash
./chaincode-invoke.sh common reference '["put","account","1","{\"name\":\"one\"}"]'
./chaincode-query.sh common reference '["list","account"]'
```

### Have other organizations join the channel

Return to *org2* console.

Join *common* and install *reference*.
```bash
./channel-join.sh common
./chaincode-install.sh reference
``` 

Test the chaincode by a query by *org2*.
```bash
./chaincode-query.sh common reference '["list","account"]'
```


# Releases\Snapshots flow

As this project doesn't have a defined release cycle yet we create `snapshot-{version}-{fabric-version}` branches
when we see code is stable enough or before introducing major changes\new features.
Note, the Hyperledger Fabric version which the snapshot is based on is defined in the `.env` file.

The _master_ branch as well as potentially _feature branches_ are used for development.
`Master` is assigned to the _latest_ version of Fabric.

Currently issued branches are:

- snapshot-0.1-1.4
- master(development)
